## About  

Welcome to my portfolio, featuring my first project built with:  
- **HTML5**
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap.**

This project represents my initial foray into web development. As a team, we used HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website. It's responsive, adapting well to different devices.

During this project, I focused on improving my coding skills, design sense, and problem-solving abilities. I addressed a specific problem and crafted a solution that reflects my dedication to practical and functional web development. It's just the beginning of my journey as a developer, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field.
